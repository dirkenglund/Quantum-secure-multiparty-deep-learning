Fitting_sigmoid.m: This file contains hardcoded results from the PyTorch simulation. It plots Figure 5 and generates an analytical approximation of the simulation results.

Leak.m: Calculates the Holevo bound (Eq. 2).

CCRB1.m: Calculates the Cram√©r-Rao bound (Eq. 3).

Maps.m: Generates Figures 2 and 6 using Leak.m and CCRB1.m.

neurons_and_loss.m: Generates Figure 5 using Leak.m and CCRB1.m.
